    <p>Ever since my first bake sale, I have loved baking and coming up with creative ways to decorate cakes. I can still remember my first-ever birthday party at a cupcake decorating place, and that truly fueled my obsession with baking. Recently, baking has more so served as a helpful stress reliever. Although, depending on the recipe, the activity can also be stress-inducing, particularly if there are a lot of moving parts and potential for things to go wrong. Since coming to college, I have not baked as many cakes as before, and I have definitely lost some patience with the entire process :/. However, it is a hobby I want to get back into and improve upon! Watching Food Network shows has also been a major pastime of mine, especially any of the baking championships series. Some of my favorite series include: Kids Baking Championship, Spring Baking Championship, and Cake Wars (I know the titles are very repetitive lol). It has always been on my bucket list to make and decorate a wedding cake as well! I could go on and on, but I do not want to bore you with more miscellaneous details. <i>So, thank you so much again for reading and learning more about my baking hobby!</i> </p>
