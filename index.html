    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p id = 'main'> <b> Hi, my name is Spring! </b>I am currently a third-year student at Northeastern studying Data Science and Finance. The combined major has really allowed me to explore both interests, and I will say DS4200 has been a very fun class so far. Data visualization is a skill I certainly want to expand upon and practice. In my free time, I love playing volleyball and basketball. I joined the Women’s Club Basketball team last year, and it has been so fun getting back to playing regularly. Playing both sports at Marino is also a good pastime, but it can be challenging if the courts are busy (which is fairly often). I also love baking and recently tried making Eric Kim’s Gochujang swirl cookies - they were very yummy :). Other notable things I have made recently include banana muffins, cinnamon rolls, and chocolate-covered Oreos. The best part about baking is not only the therapeutic process, but also being able to share homemade goodies with others. This year, my apartment has a kitchen, so that has been a game-changer for me. Some recipes that I hope to make in the future are matcha latte cookies, cream puffs, sourdough loaf, pumpkin bread, and a multi-tier cake. Thanks so much for reading a little bit more about me! </p>
